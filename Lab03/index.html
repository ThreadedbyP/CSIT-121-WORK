                <p><i>Published on September 12,2024 by Praise Idowu</i></p>
                <p>My first webpage! At first,the process seemed daunting,with so many and structures to<br>
                remember,but breaking it down step by step made it manageable.Learning how to properly<br>
                structure an HTML helped me understand how webpages are built and displayed.
            
                <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>I learned how to <i>italize</i>.</li>
                    <li>I learned how to emphazize and make texts <b>bold</b>.</li>
                    <li>I learned how to input urls, create unordered list(bullet) and ordered list</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Learning that the website numbers an ordered was very exicting. Also discovering how urls were input into website was interesting<br>
                Overall it was a great learning experience</p>

                <p id="reflection">Since lab02, I have learned more about linking external stylesheets and organizing code in a more structed way. Using the css file is definetly my go-to; it makes the html look more organized and easy to update. Yourfeedback was very insightful and helped see my mistakes.</p>
